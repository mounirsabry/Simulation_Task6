Task #6 {Submit in the week starting 20th April}

Soup Herman is a restaurant that serves soup and salad. Customers first line up in a cash register line to pay for their meals. After paying, they proceed to one of four salad bars. While all customers purchase salad, only 60% of customers go on to take the soup from one of the two soup stations.
Assume that the IAT (of customers to the restaurant) can be modeled by a Normal Distribution: {1;0.2} minutes. The time it takes to pay the cashier, get the salad, and get soup each follows a Normal Distribution. If the cashier takes an average of 40 seconds to collect money from a customer (assume std 10 seconds}; and the customer averages two minutes to get a salad (assume std 20 seconds}; and one minute to get soup (assume std 15 seconds}. 

Determine the average time a customer spends paying for and getting food if; (i) the customer is getting salad only; and (ii) the customer is getting both soup and salad.

Develop a computer program to solve the above problem (via the simulation approach).
